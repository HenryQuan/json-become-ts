Ships under flags bearing St. George's Cross clashed with their enemy in vast expanses of the world's oceans, winning glorious victories and suffering bitter defeats. However, behind each bright chapter in this part of naval combat history lies hard, sometimes barely perceptible, day-to-day work.\n\nIn the 20th century, most of the labor was performed by destroyers. They kept watch without interruption for weeks and months, bravely confronted the elements of nature out on the high seas, and countered enemy surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. There existed hardly any other ships in naval history that could have undertaken such a varied range of combat tasks, and so numerous, as the Royal Navy and Commonwealth ships did during both world wars."

During World War II, alongside other combat units of the French Navy, these powerful warships accomplished a lot of important missions, facing tough challenges and suffering significant losses."

        "description": "At the end of 1943, the German Army suffered defeat after defeat on the Eastern Front. The Allies resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic to deliver equipment and armaments to the Red Army. All large ships of the Kriegsmarine gathered in Norway to prevent this. The British forces, with the assistance of the Norwegian resistance, were closely monitoring their location and movements, grasping every opportunity to incapacitate the enemy ships. In December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers remained combat-ready in Norway. To lure the armored beast from its lair, the Allies sent another convoy, JW-55B, on a course dangerously close to the Norwegian coast. A few hours from the convoy, the Distant Cover Force, headed by Duke of York, the flagship of the Home Fleet's Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Fraser, was steaming ahead, under the cover of a storm.\n\nMuch was at stake: the shattered reputation of the Kriegsmarine, the last capable battleship of Germany, and a strategically important line for aiding the struggling Soviet Union."

        "description": "The Dunkirk Evacuation was one of the biggest battles of World War II, in which army, naval and air forces were fully involved. Within a few days, at the end of May and beginning of June 1940, more than 330,000 British and French troops were evacuated from Northern France. To save them, Allied forces had to sacrifice all equipment and most of their armament. Near Dunkirk, 2,472 guns and about 65,000 vehicles of the British Expeditionary Force and French Army were abandoned. For the evacuation, the British Admiralty called upon over 800 British, French, Dutch and Belgian war and civil ships.\n\nThis included about fifty destroyers, dozens of minesweepers, trawlers, passenger steamships, yachts, fishing boats, salvage and other vessels. One in four vessels was destroyed by the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine attacks, Wehrmacht artillery strikes and mine barriers. Within nine days of the evacuation, 145 British and 156 German aircraft were shot down in battles for air supremacy in the north of France. Winston Churchill said, 'Wars are not won by evacuations.' However, as a result of the Miracle of Dunkirk, the British Army was saved and was able to fight against the Axis powers on new battlefields, and the evacuated French troops formed the basis of the Free French Forces.\n\nFour years later, the Allies returned to France in triumph. The experience gained in organizing the large-scale troop transportation at Dunkirk was used during the Normandy landing in 1944. Later, Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay and Captain William Tennant, who were responsible for the evacuation in 1940, became the key figures on D-Day."

A specific feature of the new planes had to be their versatility: the easy replacement of their pontoons with wheeled chassis and vice versa made it possible to use them both at ground airfields and on the decks of aircraft carriers, and even with battleship and cruiser catapults. The first vehicles to be produced, which received the SC-1 Seahawk designation, were placed onboard cruiser Guam (Alaska class) in October 1944. An improved SC-2 model with a more powerful engine and better aerodynamics appeared in 1945, when the war was about to end. It would be the last U.S. Navy catapult aircraft.",

This factor eventually brought the guns' licensed production to the U.S.A. and Great Britain.

The main thing was that they themselves had to be born Italian. For example, Count Raimondo Montecuccoli (1609–1680) fought for most of his life in the forces of the Holy Roman Empire (future Austria-Hungary), which included his native Duchy of Modena.\n\nThroughout his entire military career, Count Montecuccoli has risen from the rank of being an ordinary soldier to being generalissimo of all Imperial armies. Among his rivals were the French Marshal, Henri de Turenne, the Swedish, Saxon and Turkish armies, the papal forces of the Pope, and the Prince of Transylvania. Montecuccoli's \"Memoires\" emerged as sort of a teaching guide for many commanders of the epochs that followed his own. In choosing the name for the next light cruiser, laid down in 1931, the command of the Royal Italian Navy could not ignore such an outstanding personality. The commemorative badge minted for the ship's servicemen depicts an image of the glorious commander's coat of arms with two-headed imperial eagles, and an anagram of his family name: \"A hundred eyes\" (Latin: \"Centum oculi\"), which became the unofficial motto of the cruiser.",

If troops in Africa urgently needed some sort of cargo, cruisers of the di Giussano and Cadorna classes were there to assist in this being relayed.

The Order of the Legion of Honor and the Military Medal continued to be granted relatively rarely, while hostilities at that time had risen to an unprecedented scale. The valorous service of thousands of officers, soldiers, and seamen needed to be somehow recognized. It was for this purpose that the \"Croix de Guerre\" (\"Military Cross\") was established in April 1915. \n\nThe award was given both to servicemen and civilians whose deeds of valor committed during the war were personally cited in official reports. At the same time, depending on the level from which the report came (division, squadron, fleet), a special sign in the form of a five-pointed star or a palm branch made from a particular metal was attached to the ribbon of the order. Subsequent actions worthy of citations were limited to additional ribbon devices to be affixed to the originally received insignia. Thus, Vice-Admiral Émile Guépratte, who had had three citations in the reports of the Navy's Commander, had three palm branches augmenting his Military Cross.",

It was worn around the neck, suspended from a red ribbon necklet. \n\nThroughout the history of the Order, most of its recipients were from the military.

Even relatively small \"Bourrasques\" were almost double the size of their prewar predecessors. The use of 130 mm guns on series-produced destroyers in the 1920's was an extraordinary solution, too.

In French and a number of other languages, the word \"bourrasque\" is used to mean a sharp gust of cold wind that is often aggravated by rain, hail, or snow. \n\nBy the time that World War II broke out, Bourrasque-class destroyers were already relatively outdated, yet they were still used extensively. Four destroyers were sunk during the defense of the northern coast of France between May–June 1940, including Siroco, and the lead ship Bourrasque which was lost off the coast of Dunkirk. Three more ships of the series perished during the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942.

The badge of the Order of Nakhimov, 1st Class, was made of gold and silver encrusted with rubies.\n\nOne of the recipients of the Order of Nakhimov, 1st Class, was Admiral Yury Aleksandrovich Panteleyev (1901–1983).

During World War II, he was in command of the naval defense of Leningrad, and the Belomor Military Flotilla. In his last military position, Admiral Panteleev participated in the protection of the Arctic convoys and in providing assistance for the bombing of German battleship Tirpitz by British aviation.

The 1st Class order was a five pointed platinum star with silver anchor and chain secured to it, and an enamel covered medallion struck from gold with the relief image of a naval commander. The star of the 2nd Class order was made of gold, and the anchor and the medallion were made of silver.\n\nThe Order of Ushakov was a very rare award—only 26 people received the 1st Class honor. In June 1944, Admiral Nikolay Gerasimovich Kuznetsov was awarded with the Order Badge No. 5. A year later he was awarded with the second 1st Class Order of Ushakov. The only foreigner who was awarded with this order was the British Royal Navy Admiral Bertram Ramsay, one of the Commanders of the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 and the Normandy landings in 1944. Interestingly, the Order Badge No. 1 of the 2nd Class Order of Ushakov was awarded to a distant relative of Fyodor Ushakov, and participant of two world wars, Kontr-Admiral (Rear Admiral) Yury Fyodorovich Rall (1890–1948).",

        "description": "Transformed into one of the world's most powerful fortresses under the guidance of the European engineers, Izmail was a key strong point of the Turkish army on the Danube River in the war of 1787–1791. Russian troops attempted to take the fortress several times with no success. However, in early December 1790, General Alexander Suvorov joined the command of the besiegers, and the fate of Izmail was decided. \"I came here with the troops. Twenty-four hours for reflection, and you will be given freedom. My first shot will mean your captivity. When we assault, only death awaits you\". This was Suvorov's ultimatum to the Turks. On December 11, 1790, after a violent assault, Izmail fell. Its first commandant was General Mikhail Kutuzov, who distinguished himself during the capture of the fortress and who would later defeat Napoleon in the war of 1812.\n\nInspired by its success, Catherine the Great awarded all the soldiers, cossacks and sailors who participated in the siege, a silver service medal. The medal was oval-shaped and made of silver. The monogram of the Empress was on the obverse of the medal. The inscription \"For Outstanding Bravery During the Capture of Izmail on December 11, 1790\" was on the reverse. In June 1915, almost 125 years after this glorious victory, battlecruiser Izmail was launched in St. Petersburg. It was the main cruiser in a series of four ships, each with 32,500 tons of displacement.",

Peter the Great participated in a boarding battle, as a result of which all ten enemy ships were taken. The Battle of Gangut was the first victory of the Russian regular fleet, and it was greatly celebrated in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe following medals were coined in memory of the battle: gold—for officers, silver—for sailors and soldiers. The portrait of Peter the Great wearing a suit of armor and a laurel wreath was on the obverse of the medal. The sea battle, dated July 27, 1714, between the Russian galleys and the Swedish squadron was on the reverse.

Having studied the characteristics of possible enemy ships, a special commission assembled by the Navy Chief Command came to the conclusion that Soviet ships must be armed with 457 mm guns in order to fight successfully against the most powerful of them (e.g., American Iowa-class battleships).\n\nDespite outstanding combat data (with a range of fire of up to 52 km), calculations for a triple 457 mm turret made in 1949 showed that such mounts would have substantial mass and size drawbacks. Such turrets would be almost twice as heavy as those of Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships, and the draught and cost of Project 24 ships would be beyond the reach of Soviet industry. For that matter, the project developers abandoned this armament configuration and returned to 406 mm caliber.",

The firing velocity of a 1,108 kg shell was 830 m/s. The firing range at an optimum elevation angle of 45 degrees exceeded 45.5 km. The B-37 guns were the main weapons of the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Triple turrets were designed at the Leningrad Metal Plant, which once developed turrets for the first Russian dreadnoughts.

It was obvious that other countries would soon follow the example of the British and increase the caliber of their new dreadnoughts. In this regard, the Russian Naval Services decided to make 356 mm guns the main weapon of future ships.\n\nIt is quite natural that the guns and turrets for the battleships were designed on the basis of the Gangut/Sevastopol-type guns and turrets that had already been put into production. Being very powerful for their time, the 356 mm, 52 caliber guns, developed in 1913 at the Obukhov Plant, were able to fire 748 kg shells at a range of more than 23 km at a maximum turret elevation angle of 25 degrees, according to the project. In 1914, World War I was the reason the Empire's industry diverted to the more pressing issues. As a result, work on neither the battleships nor the turrets was ever completed. The 356 mm gun only was put into operation in test range equipment operated during the Leningrad defense of World War II.",

Initially, the armament of the designed battleship was supposed to be placed in double-gun turrets, but the Naval General Staff insisted on installation in triple turrets.\n\nThe new 305 mm, 52 caliber gun was designed at the Obukhov Plant in St. Petersburg. The first copy was made in 1907. The three-gun turret was developed at the Metal Plant in St. Petersburg. The turrets of the Baltic battleships (Sevastopol, Gangut, and others) were protected by 203 mm thick armored plates. The maximum gun elevation angle was 25 degrees, which provided a 24 km range of fire of the 1911 shell.

Kontr-Admiral Rall, Chief of Staff of the Baltic Navy, requested the higher authorities to produce a more reliable pistol at one of the Leningrad plants to arm the naval officers.\n\nAfter considering the issue, the Leningrad Regional Committee of the Communist Party appointed Plant No. 181 to design and manufacture the first batch of new pistols as soon as possible. Having received just drawings of the parts in January 1942, the masters at the plant made a prototype by hand. In March 1942, it was successfully tested at the temperature of −30 degrees Celsius. The pistol, named Baltiets in honor of the Baltic Navy, had a 7.62 mm caliber and a magazine for eight cartridges. Under the blockade, a total of 14 Baltiets pistols were made by hand.

During World War II, the squadron's aircraft took off from the decks of a variety of aircraft carriers—the honored Furious, the legendary Ark Royal, and the state-of-the-art Indomitable. In April 1940, during the Norwegian campaign, the squadron was reported to have become the first ever aircraft formation to sink a major combat ship. It happened during the raid on Bergen, where Skua dive bombers sent German light cruiser Königsberg to the bottom.\n\nThe combat geography of the 800 Naval Air Squadron is extremely extensive, with its aircraft operating in the Arctic and Mediterranean, in the hunt for Bismarck, and in covering the Allied landings in Madagascar and North Africa. In the summer of 1943, the squadron became the first Naval Air Force division to be equipped with American-made Grumman Hellcat fighters. The Hellcats of the 800 Air Squadron covered a strike of British dive bombers on battleship Tirpitz during Operation Tungsten, in April 1944.

However, unlike her predecessors, HMS Implacable had a double-deck hangar, which, coupled with the possibility of placing aircraft directly on the deck, significantly increased the size of her air group.\n\nAfter entering service and until the end of 1944, Implacable took part in hostilities off the coast of Norway. In the spring of 1945, she headed for the Pacific Ocean, with the largest air group onboard ever deployed on a British aircraft carrier—81 aircraft. Throughout a period of several months until the end of World War II, HMS Implacable took part in strikes against strategic targets on the Japanese islands. After the war, for a long time, the aircraft carrier served as a training ship to test out the latest models of carrier-based aircraft. In 1949, she was the flagship of the Home Fleet. Six years later, HMS Implacable was sold for scrap.",

It was laid down in 1915 as a ship of a unique type—a light battlecruiser. When, two years later, Furious entered service, she was a strange hybrid: on her bow she had a hangar with a flight deck, while her stern was occupied by a turret with a 457 mm gun, a monstrous weapon for its time. Furious would enter service three more times, following another modernization that changed her appearance. By 1932, she had been turned into an aircraft carrier with an island-type superstructure and flight deck occupying three-quarters of her hull's length. She was capable of accelerating to nearly 30 knots and carrying more than 30 aircraft onboard.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, HMS Furious hunted German raiders in the Atlantic. In the spring of 1940, she took an active part in the Norwegian operation. Later on, her main goal mostly consisted of transferring aircraft to various theaters of war, from the Arctic to Malta. In late 1942, she covered the landing in North Africa and, in 1944, she participated in striking battleship Tirpitz, based in Norway. A few months prior to the end of the war in Europe, the old ship was put into reserve and then removed from the fleet lists.",

On the basis of the results of trials held with her predecessors, ships converted from other types, changes in the new project were made even at the final stages of construction. As a result, the ship that entered service in early 1924 had all of the features of a classic aircraft carrier: a closed hangar, solid flight deck, and an island-type superstructure shifted to the starboard side. The 11,000-ton HMS Hermes could carry two dozen planes onboard and reach a speed of up to 25 knots.\n\nHMS Hermes spent most of her peacetime service in the Far East, looking after the interests of the British Crown in the region. One of the tasks that she had to perform—quite unusual for an aircraft carrier—was to fight against pirates. At the beginning of World War II, Hermes, based out of African ports, participated in the search for German raiders and blockade breakers in Atlantic waters. In early 1942, she was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and arrived in Ceylon. In April of the same year, the Japanese fleet launched a raid in the Indian Ocean. On April 9, HMS Hermes, on her voyage to join with the main forces of the Eastern Fleet, was intercepted and sunk by Japanese dive bombers.",

However, the endless stream of discrepant requirements from the Ministry of Aviation to change the design delayed the work for almost a decade. As a result, when the production of the aircraft, named \"Barracuda\", finally commenced in 1942, its characteristics were far from impressive. The Barracuda II, which began to enter service in the Naval Air Force in early 1943, was slightly better with a more powerful 1,600 hp engine.\n\nThe not-too-fast and not-very-maneuverable Barracuda didn't make for a good torpedo bomber. But a number of constructive advantages allowed it to cope well with the role of a dive bomber. The most striking moment of its career was during operation Tungsten, which involved striking battleship Tirpitz, hiding in one of the Norwegian fjords. On April 4, 1944, forty-two Barracudas, coming in two waves, hit the battleship 14 times with their bombs, losing only three planes in the assault. The battleship was put out of action for several months. As the Air Force was obtaining American Grumman Avengers—which surpassed the Barracudas in all respects—as part of a lend-lease, the British aircraft became auxiliary planes, focusing mainly on reconnaissance, the mining of enemy harbors and fairways, anti-submarine patrols, and transporting.",

Developed in the mid-1930s, the biplane, with its linen trim and open cockpit, was produced until 1944. It participated in hostilities until 1945, leaving an everlasting trace in the history of naval aviation. The Swordfish was developed by Fairey company as a torpedo bomber, reconnaissance plane, and spotting aircraft, with the first machines entering service in 1936. The biplane had rather modest speed characteristics, but at the same time it had a sufficiently large action radius and could carry more than 750 kg of weapons payload.\n\nThe Royal Navy actively engaged Swordfishes in the initial period of World War II, despite its extremely archaic design. But this impudence (very British, wouldn't you say?) turned out to be impressively beneficial. On November 12, 1940, in the still of the night, twelve Swordfishes attacked the Italian Navy base in Taranto, wrecking three battleships while losing only two aircraft. With this victory, the British torpedo bombers both changed the course of the war in the Mediterranean and made a strong statement that naval aviation had become an important strategic weapon. In May 1941, a torpedo dropped by a Swordfish made the famous Bismarck face her doom. Subsequently, this easy-to-pilot biplane, with its modest takeoff and landing condition requirements, took its well-deserved place on the decks of the small escort aircraft carriers that accompanied convoys in the Atlantic and Arctic. Equipped with radar and rocket launchers (!), Swordfishes successfully pursued and sank U-boats until 1945.",

The plane that came off the assembly lines in the spring of 1942 was large and heavy, but actually this was its main advantage: due to the large volume of its fuel tanks, the aircraft had an unsurpassed action radius. Additionally, its capacious bomb compartment enabled it to carry a 570 mm torpedo or over 900 kg of bombs. Moreover, the torpedo bomber was armed with four machine guns, and the seats for its three crew members were well protected by armor. A powerful 1,900 hp engine ensured that this heavy load reached its destination, and at an excellent speed.\n\nSince August 1942, each and every large-scale operation in the Pacific Theater involved Avengers. From autumn of the same year, they took part in the battle for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean as well.

Avengers acted both as air-to-water bombers and attack aircraft, as well as strike aircraft raiding enemy onshore positions. Equipped with radar, they proved to be wonderful reconnaissance and anti-submarine defense planes, having sunk dozens of submarines.\n\nTheir load capacity, range, and potential for refurbishment ensured that the Avengers had a long career in the armed forces of seven countries of the world.

The new ship was smaller than her predecessors, but she was almost as fast. She also had much better armament, with eight 165 mm guns in comparison to the two 165 mm and six 139 mm carried by Châteaurenault and Guichen. Extended trials delayed her commissioning, and, as a result, Jurien de la Gravière was completed only in 1903.

During her trial period, in early 1902, she received an original paint scheme that, became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy for a short period of time and was not used in any other Navy of the world. In accordance with this scheme, the ship's side, masts, and funnels were covered with black paint, while superstructures, turret mounts, and lifeboats were painted white.

The arrival of Varyag was part of an expedition of the Russian fleet to the shores of North America. Their purpose was to create a threat to the ocean shipping lines between England and France, which at that time were quite hostile to Russia. The appearance of the Russian squadrons was perhaps even more valuable for the United States, as the country's position on the world stage at the height of the Civil War was extremely precarious.\nOn May 22, 1899, the ceremonial laying down of armored cruiser Varyag, ordered by the Russian Empire, took place at the William Cramp shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Less than six months later, on October 31, the hull of the ship was launched. On April 2, 1901, the fully-equipped cruiser, flashing her snow-white sides, left the famous Hampton roads and headed into the Atlantic Ocean to reprise the path of her namesake, only in the opposite direction. On May 13, having sailed about 5,000 miles, Varyag arrived at the Port of Revel where, 38 years before, the corvette of the same name had departed on her journey towards the shores of the USA.",

These were, as a rule, relatively small but well-armed, high-speed ships, with their main defense consisting of an armored deck with inclined sides. These relatively cheap cruisers were built mostly by order of countries that wanted to have their own navies but were extremely limited in resources.\nIn 1895, Armstrong received an order from Brazil to build three armored cruisers with a displacement of about 3,500 tons, and main armament of rapid-fire 152 mm guns. However, the customer's finances quickly ran low, which resulted in the Brazilian Navy receiving only one ship of this class, named the Almirante Barroso. The lead cruiser of the series was bought by Chile, while the third and the fourth ones – the latter being ordered by Brazil instead of the lead ship – were purchased by the United States, a country that could not be said as being limited in funds. The reason behind it was that, in 1898, at the height of the ships' construction, the Spanish-American war broke out, and the United States government feared that the Elswicks would be acquired by Spain, which needed to replenish its fleet with up-to-date combat units. As a result, from 1898–1900, USS New Orleans and USS Albany raised star-spangled banners and became the last major ships built abroad to become part of the U.S. Navy.",

The image of the crown of German Emperors was placed above the letter. Its design, resembling the crown of the Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, was developed in 1871 with the unification of Germany.

Nicknamed Großer Kurfürst (German for Great Elector), he was able to turn his principality, devastated by the Thirty Years' War, into a noticeable force in Europe within just half a century of his rule. Thrifty and faithful to the ideals of strict justice, Friedrich Wilhelm was actively promoting innovation in all spheres, investing gradually and increasing the resources of the state in the development of industry, science, and education. Pursuing active foreign policy, the Great Elector not only formed a strong army but also built a rather large navy.\nThe first ship named in honor of Friedrich Wilhelm was a sailing frigate, launched when the Elector was still alive. In 1878, several years after the founding of the Imperial German Navy (Kaiserliche Marine), the ironclad turret ship Großer Kurfürst was commissioned. It was the Elector's descendant, German Emperor Wilhelm II, who in the late 19th century set about creating a powerful navy. One of the first battleships to be launched was Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. Two decades later, in July 1914, the König-class dreadnought battleship Großer Kurfürst joined the Kaiserliche Marine. The last of the \"Great Electors\" took part in a number of combat operations during World War I, including the famous Battle of Jutland.

According to the chronicles, the fleet assembled by the Prince for this purpose consisted of 2,000 ships. The story goes that in order to prevent the Rus people from entering the city, the Golden Horn waterway was blocked by a chain, but Oleg put his ships on wheels and proceeded to Constantinople by land. The stunned Byzantines asked for peace following this.\nNaming ships of the Russian Imperial Navy in honor of the legendary characters of ancient Russian history and mythology became especially popular in the middle of the 19th century. In 1860, propeller frigate Oleg was launched in Kronstadt. The next ship that would be named in honor of the conqueror of Constantinople was the Bogatyr-class armored cruiser, laid down in St. Petersburg in 1902. The second Oleg, barely completed in the autumn of 1904 at the height of the war with Japan, was sent to the Far East as a member of the notorious 2nd Pacific Squadron. Having avoided sinking in the Battle of Tsushima, the cruiser returned to the Baltic after the war. During World War I, she participated in covering minelaying operations and carried out raids on enemy communications facilities. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Oleg became part of the Naval Forces of the 'Workers and Peasants' Red Army.

Some areas of the hull were painted dark gray (MS1).\n\nThe silhouette of a ship using such a light disruptive scheme, under certain visibility conditions, was completely indistinguishable. However, it was not easy to preserve the multicolor paintwork with an individual pattern on the ship. As a result, camouflage patterns in the British Navy were developed along the path of further unification and simplification of colors and patterns used.",

At the same time, a simpler, two-color pattern became widespread across the Mediterranean fleet. The goal was not to conceal the ship, which would be quite challenging in regular clashes with the Italians in the open sea, but to disorient the enemy in respect of the perceived distance to target. \n\nThis camouflage pattern, characteristic for destroyers of the Mediterranean fleet in particular, was obtained by applying large broken stripes and black or dark gray spots (MS1, then G5) on the light gray hull of the ship (507c or MS4a, in accordance with the coding of shades adopted by the Admiralty). The black-and-gray camouflage was most prevalent between 1940 and 1941, but it was used later also.",

However, solid coloring did not suit close inshore operations, and soon some of the ships of the Home Fleet came to boast a variety of two- or three-color disruptive camouflage patterns.\n\nThe first camouflage schemes that were used by the Royal Navy during the war were unofficial. The camouflage was applied to the ship's hull by order of her Commander or by the order of the Captain's immediate superiors—Commanders of small units, of destroyer flotillas, etc. The crews used only colors that were immediately available. Clearly, the one most readily available was protective (\"khaki\") or black paint that was applied in spots on top of the standard gray. Such was the pattern of, for example, G-class destroyer HMS Grenade, that was involved in the Dunkirk evacuation. The extended, official palette of colors that had a special encoding and was designed for the concealment of ships, appeared only in 1941.",

This convoy would persevere in the history books under the name of Tarigo, after the Italian destroyer that was the escort's flagship.\n\nOn April 15, 1941, British aviation reconnaissance discovered several enemy transport ships heading southward, accompanied by three destroyers. The interception of the convoy from Malta was assigned to Force \"K\", which included two J-class and two Tribal-class destroyers. The Force was led by Captain (D) Philip Mack, holding his pennant on board HMS Jervis. In the early hours of April 16, British destroyers literally descended upon the unsuspecting convoy, quickly turning the fight into a battle at pistol-shot distance. Three Italian destroyers from the escort resisted the fierce attack, but they could do very little against the twenty-eight 120 mm British guns. At the cost of losing one ship, receiving a torpedo hit at close range, Force K sent the entire convoy—three destroyers and five transport ships—to the bottom of the sea, depriving General Rommel of 1,700 soldiers and several thousand tons of cargo that would have been incredibly valuable to him.",

This operation preserved the lives and freedom of trained military personnel, enabling them to continue their fight in the war. With the cost of the operation being a number of ships and small vessels sunk, the quick decisions made by the navy, improvising at every turn, and the incredible dedication shown by British sailors, soldiers, and civilians, worked miracles in those days.\n\nNearly forty of the Royal Navy destroyers that participated in Operation Dynamo accounted for around a third of all evacuees. Initially, the warships assembled for the operation only intended to cover the boarding of the evacuated soldiers onto civilian ships. However, it would have been nearly impossible to save as many if the original plan was stuck to. So, on the night of May 28, by the light of the fires raging in the city tormented by the Luftwaffe, HMS Wakeful and HMS Gallant were the first to enter Dunkirk's harbor and board soldiers directly from the embankments, while other destroyers joined the evacuation from nearby beaches.

However, the British Navy would have no alternative to this weapon until the massive shipments of 20 mm Oerlikon automatic guns commenced.

It was designed by the Vickers company and went into service from 1915 under the designation \"2-pounder Mark II gun\". The gun was nicknamed the pom-pom because of the characteristic sound it produced when firing. Mark II guns were almost solely produced as single-mounts with manual aiming. Some of the initial pom-pom guns would also be used during World War II, mostly on mobilized civil vessels.\n\nThe early 1920s saw the start of development of a 40 mm multi-barreled AA gun with a power drive. Due to poor funding, typical of the British Admiralty in the 1920s, the process of accepting the new gun into service was a very long one. Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams. The pom-pom gun was inferior in terms of almost all performance characteristics in comparison to Bofors AA automatic guns of the same caliber. The latter though were under-produced, which is why they never superseded the presence of pom-pom guns on British ships.",

The elevation angle of the first mounts was 30 degrees, which later was increased to 40, and then further to 55 degrees. The maximum range of fire at the elevation of 30 degrees was about 14.5 km.\n\nMost destroyers built in Britain between 1930 and 1940 were armed with the Mark IX gun model for their main battery artillery. All so-called \"standard\" destroyers starting from the A class, up to the I class, as well as several series of ships of from the time of war, carried four single-mounts each. The J-, K-, N-, and Tribal-class destroyers were equipped with the same guns, but placed in twin-mounts. Fast-firing and quite powerful Mark IX guns were well-suited to hit-and-run battles at short- and mid-range, which is why British sailors valued them so much. The major drawback of this system, that prominently manifested itself in the very first months of World War II, was its inability to effectively fire at airborne targets. The poor ability of the Mark IX to repel the attacks of the Luftwaffe's dive bombers, the nemeses of British destroyers, forced the British Admiralty to focus on the development of dual-purpose guns.",

This designation was given to a large group of ships of this type that were built in the U.K. between 1924 and 1938. They shared a \"standard\" arrangement, mainly inherited from the V and W classes, with water displacement of around 1,300 tons, a speed of around 35–37 knots, and armament consisting of four 120 mm guns and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Initially, in 1936, the British Navy ordered eight I-class destroyers that were supposed to form one flotilla. It's worth mentioning though that their flotilla leader was built as part of a separate project. Some time later, by the order of the Turkish Navy, four more ships carrying less powerful torpedo armament were built, two of which were inducted into the Royal Navy during World War II.\n\nThe operational record of HMS Icarus was extremely intense. In April 1940, the destroyer took part in the Norwegian Campaign, capturing a German transport ship and playing her role in the Second Battle of Narvik, a glorious event for the Royal Navy. Soon after, HMS Icarus was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. In May 1941, she made an appearance in the well-known Hunt for Bismarck. In the summer of 1944, the destroyer covered the landing operation in Normandy. Besides these roles, throughout the entire war, HMS Icarus participated in a range of convoy operations in the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Region, and Mediterranean during which time she added four sunk German submarines to her combat record.

These ships represented a breakthrough for their time, and defined the general appearance of destroyers not only in the British Navy, but also across the other leading navies of the world for a long time to come. Their large dimensions resulted in sea-keeping characteristics and sea endurance good enough to operate conjointly with battle squadrons. Another progressive solution was the placement of artillery guns in super-firing turrets, which later became a standard scheme for subsequent generations of destroyers.\n\nFollowing HMS Valkyrie and her sister ships, several further series of ships were built resembling her, in regard to arrangement and characteristics.

The cross is particularly significant because it is awarded for outstanding heroism shown exclusively in battle.\n\nThe Navy Cross was established in 1919 to reward service members whose feats could not be marked with a Medal of Honor—the highest and, at that time, the sole U.S. award for combat action. In total, more than 6,000 people have been bestowed with the cross since its creation. During the Pacific Campaign, Robert Hayler, who became a United States Navy Vice Admiral after the war, received three Navy Crosses. He was awarded twice for his heroism as commander of USS Honolulu, a Brooklyn-class light cruiser, with which he participated in a number of violent sea battles near the Solomon Islands.\n\nFor his contribution to the defeat of the Japanese forces at Surigao Strait in October 1944, Hayler, who at that time commanded Cruiser Division 12 as Rear Admiral, received his third navy cross.",

This weapon which had a very high aiming speed (24 degrees per second horizontally, 30 degrees per second vertically), the ability to fire up to 50 shells per minute from each barrel, exhaustive destructive force of the projectile, with a maximum engagement of over 9 km in height, crowned the development of American AA defense systems in the 1940s.\n\nOne of the first to receive Mark 33 mounts was light cruiser Worcester, commissioned in 1948.

The Becker gun, which had a high rate of fire and light weight for its time, was intended for mounting on airplanes and the legendary Zeppelins. From Germany, demilitarized after World War I, the production of the 20 mm gun was moved to the Swiss company SEMAG, and then, after its collapse, to Oerlikon.\n\nInitially, the Swiss version of the 20 mm gun did not have any impressive characteristics. In 1935, the U.S.A., having purchased samples of the gun for testing, refused to use Oerlikons, which put the Swiss company on the brink of bankruptcy. Ironically, Oerlikon managed to continue working on improvements to the gun's design thanks to Japan which purchased a license for production of the 20 mm guns. Japanese Oerlikons, designated as Type 99, became the basis for the armament of the famous Zero fighter aircraft.\n\nIn 1940, during the war, the United States began looking for a replacement for the obsolete and weak Browning AA machine guns. The 20 mm automatic Oerlikon, significantly improved by that time, proved to be very useful. In 1941, its production was deployed in the U.S.A., and soon the Oerlikons were mounted on almost every warship, from boats to battleships.",

Their rotation speed was up to 25 degrees per second with the ability to shoot about 12 shells per minute from each barrel.

In 1932, for the new generation of light cruisers, the Mark 16 gun was developed. It was designed for a \"super-heavy\" shell weighing 59 kg, significantly superior to its counterparts in destructive power.

A relatively small initial velocity of heavy shell and close location of the barrels in the turret had an adverse effect on the firing accuracy over long distances. However, the turret's ability to shoot up to 30 shells per minute made it an extremely formidable weapon in close- and medium-ranged battles.

The technological level of the previous, pre-dreadnought era ships did not allow for the creation of sufficiently reliable turret mounts with high-speed gun movement to improve aim at the target. Because of this, in the early 20th century, rapid-fire guns were placed on cruisers, as a rule, right on the deck or in casemates, which limited their firing range and did not ensure their reliable operation in difficult weather conditions.\n\nCommissioning of Omaha-class cruisers in 1923–1925 marked a gradual transition to the deployment of all main battery guns on cruisers in turret mounts.",

In total, four ships were ordered under the project, but the order for two ships, one of which had been already laid down by that time, was abolished in August 1945, when the victory of the U.S.A. in the war with Japan became a fact.\n\nAfter joining the U.S. Navy, USS Worcester spent most of her service outside the native waters, \"demonstrating her flag\" in the Mediterranean, Latin America, Northern Europe, and the Pacific.\n\nFor participation in the Korean War in 1950–1953, the ship was awarded with two battle stars.\n\nIn 1970, already obsolete due to the development of AA defense missiles, USS Worcester was removed from the fleet lists.",

The US Navy Command could replenish their growing fleet with light cruisers without considering their water displacement. However, the world conflict was intensifying, so they had to act quickly. In order to save the time required to design a project from a scratch, the recent \"big\" light cruisers—St. Louis and Helena—were used as a basis for the new project.\n\nA requirement to reinforce the ships AA capabilities and desire to mount advanced gunfire control systems and surveillance radars led to the decision to remove one of the 152 mm turrets. The resulting light cruiser, armed with twelve 152 mm guns, was in no way inferior to most ships of her type in terms of main battery firepower, and outmatched all of them in terms of AA gun strength and an abundance of modern equipment.\n\nThe second ship in the series, USS Columbia, named after the state capital of South Carolina, was constructed almost concurrently with the lead ship, USS Cleveland, and was commissioned in July 1942.\n\nThe most impressive episode of her combat service was her participation in the Bougainville Campaign (the Solomon Islands) in November 1943. On November 1, four Cleveland-class cruisers, including USS Columbia, delivered extremely intense fire with their rapid-firing guns on the enemy positions on the island. Several hours later, during the night battle that later became known as the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, they managed to fend off an attack by a powerful Japanese squadron on the Americans landing place on the Bougainville island without loss.\n\nShortly afterwards, in the morning of November 2, USS Columbia, together with her three sister ships, repelled a massive enemy air raid during which they shot down more than 20 aircraft, again without loss.",

They owe their appearance to the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited displacement for new cruisers to 8,000 tons. It was impossible to design a full-fledged multi-purpose cruiser in this context. At the same time, the successful tests of 127 mm dual-purpose twin mounts gave impulse to the Navy command to create a cruiser with such turrets as her main battery.\n\nThe first four ships under this project were laid down in the spring of 1940. The lead ship, USS Atlanta, named after the state capital of Georgia, entered service in late 1941. Despite the impressive number of dual-purpose guns mounted on the cruiser (sixteen), she was not considered an AA defense cruiser and had to fulfil primarily the duties of a scout and destroyer flotilla leader.\n\nHaving arrived at the Pacific Theater of operations, USS Atlanta immediately engaged in active combat activities, taking part in the Battle of Midway, the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and a number of less significant operations. On the night of November 13, 1942, the cruiser was in the epicenter of the battle, known as the Battle of Friday the 13th—one of the most controversial battles in the history of the war in the Pacific Ocean. The American squadron, consisting of five cruisers and eight destroyers, intercepted the Japanese task force (two battleships, a cruiser, and 11 destroyers) sent for the attack on Guadalcanal. The U.S. ships, thanks to their radars, were the first to detect the enemy, but were inexcusably late to open fire. As a result, two columns, American and Japanese, literally collapsed one into the other on a dark tropical night, breaking the formation. In the resulting pileup, where they almost made contact, the sides used not only torpedoes and main battery against each other, but even AA guns. From the very beginning of the battle, Atlanta, furiously shooting in all directions from her rapid-fire mounts, was hit many times, including by one or two torpedoes. For a small, lightly armored cruiser, it was enough, and before the day was over she sank.",

The project of a light cruiser with 152 mm artillery, which had been in development since 1930, was quickly revised, and her four triple turrets were complemented with the fifth one. This was the birth of the Brooklyn class.\n\nIn 1935, when most of these cruisers had already been laid down, an updated project was prepared. The advanced design had a new propulsion and a full-fledged dual-purpose artillery consisting of the newest twin 127 mm turrets. A year later, two ships—USS St. Louis and USS Helena—were laid down, becoming part of the Navy in 1939.\n\nLight cruiser Helena became one of the victims of the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, being hit by a torpedo once. After completion of the repair works in the summer of 1942, the cruiser actively joined the fight for the Solomon Islands, taking part in several major battles, the most successful of which being a night battle of Cape Esperance in October 1942. Thanks to the newest radar mounted on it, USS Helena was the first to disclose the approach of a Japanese squadron. Allowing the enemy ships to approach at a close distance, the cruiser was the first to burst her rapid fire at the Japanese. USS Helena's shells proved fatal for destroyer Fubuki and set cruiser Furutaka ablaze. The result of the battle was a hasty retreat of the defeated Japanese squadron.\n\nCruiser Helena's promising career tragically ended in July 1943, when three 610 mm torpedoes from Japanese destroyers sank her in the Battle of Kula Gulf.",

In consideration of international treaties in relation to displacement and armament (10,000 tons, 203 mm guns), she had significantly improved armor. The ship's vital parts were protected from artillery equal in caliber to her own—in this regard the new project surpassed all the previous ones. USS New Orleans became the lead ship in a series of seven vessels. This ship, named after the city in Louisiana, was commissioned in 1934.\n\nDuring World War II, New Orleans-class cruisers took part in numerous military operations.

She was built very quickly and commissioned in just two and a half years, even more quickly than the lead ship of the series, Pensacola, that was laid down a few months earlier.\n\nThe previous stage of design took much more time. The idea to create a 10,000-ton, high-speed cruiser with 203 mm artillery appeared in 1918. Until 1926, dozens of versions of such ships were considered, with different armament, armor, and speed.\n\nSalt Lake City and Pensacola entered service in 1929–1930 and had an impressive firepower of ten 203 mm guns. At the same time, due to their weak armor, they were classified as light cruisers. Only in 1931 was their classification brought in line with international classification, and Pensacola with Salt Lake City became \"heavier\".\n\nThe service of USS Salt Lake City during World War II was very intense. Twice her armor and firepower were tested in artillery combats with heavy Japanese cruisers. First, in October 1942, in the Battle of Cape Esperance near the Solomon Islands, when the U.S. ships caught the Japanese force off guard and managed to cause serious losses among them, forcing them to flee. In March 1943, a small squadron with Salt Lake City at the core intercepted the Japanese cover forces, escorting the transports with assault troopers on board, near the Komandorski Islands. The enemy force included two heavy cruisers, each of which was more powerful than their overseas counterpart. However, the U.S. squadron engaged in the fight and, within a few hours, Salt Lake City was boldly maneuvering and firing at an enemy twice as powerful as the American ship. The weak armor of the cruiser couldn't withstand hits of 203 mm shells, which nearly led to a tragic finale. However, both Japanese cruisers were damaged by Salt Lake City's guns and had used almost all of their ammunition.

The lead ship under the name of Omaha, a city in the state of Nebraska, was laid down at the end of 1918.

Because of this, the Navy command used them mainly for performing tasks on minor battlefields.\n\nUSS Omaha successfully hunted for the German blockade runners in the Atlantic, and, in 1944, supported the Allies landing in Southern France with fire.\n\nIn March 1943, her sister ship, USS Richmond, took part in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands in the Bering Sea, where a small U.S. squadron recklessly attacked a mighty Japanese force and made it renege their mission and turn back.",

        "description": "In 1912, a decision was finally reached to proceed with building the third series of battleships for the French Navy. However, plans to make new ships of the Normandie class more powerful than their predecessors were hindered by production constraints, as at that time French shipyards were not big enough to allow for any significant increase in the size of warships. Moreover, the French didn't have guns that were more powerful than the 340 mm guns, which were to be mounted on the Bretagne-class battleships that were at their final stages of construction, and the design of a new gun weapon system would be too expensive timewise. Ultimately, engineers came up with an innovative solution: to mount the main guns intended for the Normandie-class battleships in quad turrets.\n\nThe new turret, which would have become the first quad turret ever mounted on a ship, was designed to have a rate of fire of up to two shots per minute. The front armor plates protecting the guns were to have been 340 mm thick. In total, plans were made to build 31 units: each of the five Normandie-class battleships laid down in 1913–1914 was supposed to carry three such turrets, while the Lyon-class warships ordered in 1915 were designed to carry as many as four.",

The main advantage of the new construction, which distinguished it from previous ones, was inclined armored plates which turned out to be more durable. However, the guns in the turrets were almost the same as those mounted on the last French pre-dreadnought battleships of the Danton class.\n\nThe turrets had up to 290 mm of armor and the loading gear was designed to fire up to two 432 kg AP shells per minute. The main disadvantage of Courbet's turrets was a small gun elevation angle (12 degrees only), which significantly decreased the ship's firing range. That shortcoming was fixed only during a major ship refit of 1922–1924 when the angle was increased to 23 degrees.",

However, significant changes were made to the project designs at the development stage with the last ship carrying the name of a historical province in the south-west of France—Gascogne—designed almost from scratch.\n\nGascogne's main difference from Richelieu was a more conventional placement of the main battery turrets—at the fore and aft ends of the ship. Other important changes were the shift of the propulsion unit closer to the ship's fore end and reinforcement of her AA defenses by increasing the number of 100 mm and 37 mm guns. The keel-laying that had been postponed several times was ultimately to take place in the summer of 1940. But after France withdrew from the war in June of the same year, preparations for the construction of the battleship ceased. The preceding warship Gascogne, one in a series of Normandie-class battleships, did not fare any better. Laid down in 1913 while still under construction, she was decommissioned for scrap.",

Historically, the province comprised two regions which later transformed into departments—Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin—so the first Coat of Arms of Alsace, approved in 1948, comprised elements from the Coats of Arms of both departments.\n\nIn 1939, France found out that Germany was pursuing a program for the construction of H-class battleships. In response, a decision was made to lay down two battleships capable of withstanding the new threat. One of the draft projects, the most powerful one, provided for twelve 380 mm main guns placed in three turrets, a speed of 32 knots and a 350-mm-thick main armor belt. A construction order was placed in April 1940. One month later, names were suggested for the future steel monsters. The first on the list was Alsace, apparently in the teeth of the geopolitical rival. But the defeat of the French army, and the country's capitulation in June 1940, crippled plans to build the most powerful battleships the French Republic ever had.",

Turenne's innovative approach based on fearless maneuvering on the battlefield and concentrating troops along the main sector of the front helped him secure several brilliant victories during the wars with Spain and Holland. The glorious Marshal's life was taken by an enemy cannonball in his next battle.\n\nThe French Navy paid their respects to Turenne by assigning his name to two large battle units—a 100-gun ship-of-the-line launched in 1854 and an ironclad that entered service in 1882. Early in the 20th century, France was considering a project to build an \"all-big-gun\" battleship as a next step in the evolution of the Danton-class pre-dreadnought battleships, also to be named after one of the most prominent figures in French history.",

This was quite a surprise, because the Co-op Battles mode was initially designed to let them try out new ships they obtained in the game – that's it. However, the number of people who like it and the success of the Halloween campaign showed that PvE battles deserve further consideration.\n\nThe first season of Operations came out with the release of Update 0.6.6 and offered four unique battle scenarios: defending a naval base, mounting an attack on a convoy, delivering a strike at a base, and escorting an aircraft carrier. It's noteworthy that bots got a bit smarter and PvE is gradually evolving from a shooting gallery with ships to a distinct, interesting battle mode.",

In 1888, the Imperial Naval Academy was moved to the island of Etajima situated in Hiroshima Bay, where a special building was constructed to accommodate it in 1893.\n\nAlmost without exception, officers of the Imperial Navy passed through the halls of this Academy. On Etajima, during three years of training in a severe and ascetic atmosphere, the samurai spirit of future combat commanders was tempered.

The battleship's main battery included the most powerful naval guns in the world, namely nine 460 mm guns. Yamamoto, who later flew his flag on both ships during his service at the Navy Ministry, was opposed to the idea of building extremely expensive giants such as Musashi and Yamato, considering such expenditure of resources unreasonable.\n\nIn February 1943, Musashi arrived at the main Japanese Navy base on Truk island. The brand new battleship was specifically equipped to serve as a flagship. Therefore, Yamamoto transferred his flag to Musashi immediately after her arrival. Several weeks later, the Admiral set out on the fateful trip to Rabaul. In May 1943, the ashes of the perished Yamamoto were brought to Japan onboard his final flagship, battleship Musashi.",

She is 55 m long, 7 m wide, and could work up the speed of 13 knots. At the beginning of the war, she was mobilized and equipped with mine-sweeping arrangement, a 76 mm AA gun and two machine guns. The steamship crossed the English Channel seven times and was taking soldiers aboard right from the beaches. This river ship carried to England 7,000 persons, and her anti-aircraft gunners shot down at least one German aircraft. The rescued people gave to Medway Queen the title of \"The Heroine of Dunkirk\". After the war, the steamship started her routine work, and since 1966 she was a marina nightclub. From 1978, several attempts to preserve the ship were made, but only in 2006 the Medway Queen Preservation Society was able to raise enough funds for her restoration. In 2013, the work was finished, and now \"The Heroine of Dunkirk\" is at rest on the River Medway in the Kent County.",

During the war, they were involved in patrolling, countermine, and antisubmarine operations. In peacetime, they were disarmed and sent to private owners. With the beginning of World War II, trawlers were mobilized again, including John Cattling, which became a minesweeper due to its characteristics: 276 t displacement, 38 m long, 7.2 m wide, and with a speed of 10 kt. On May 29, 1940, near the Dunkirk pierhead, the English destroyer Grenade was hit by two bombs. Uncontrolled and set on fire, this ship drifted towards the bay mouth and was likely to block it. John Cattling was able to take Grenade and pull it off to the outer harbor, where the destroyer exploded. The trawler served as a minesweeper until the end of the war.
